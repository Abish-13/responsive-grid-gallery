## ‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

-   **CSS Grid Layout:** Implemented a robust grid system using `display: grid`.
-   **Advanced Responsive Technique:** Utilized the `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` pattern for the grid columns. This is a modern, efficient method to create fluid layouts that automatically wrap and adjust based on viewport width, showcasing an understanding of professional front-end practices.
-   **Flexbox for Alignment:** Used `display: flex` within the grid items to perfectly center the text overlay, demonstrating proficiency in multiple modern layout modules.
-   **Interactive UI with Hover Effects:** Added CSS transitions to create a smooth zoom effect on the images and a fade-in overlay, enhancing the user experience and demonstrating an eye for detail.
-   **Image Handling:** Used the `object-fit: cover` property to ensure images maintain their aspect ratio and fill their containers gracefully.
